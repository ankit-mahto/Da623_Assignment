**Assignment: Binary Classification of Logistic Regression**

**Author:** Ankit Mahto  
**Roll:** 200122011  
**Course:** DA623 - Computing with signals

**Description:**

This Python notebook (`.ipynb` file) serves as an assignment submission for the course DA623 - Computing with signals. The assignment focuses on training and demonstrating the decision boundary of binary classification using logistic regression.

**Topic:**

The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a logistic regression model for binary classification. Specifically, it aims to delineate the decision boundary between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals using two key features: BMI (Body Mass Index) and s5 (blood sugar level).

**Data Set:**

The code utilizes the diabetes dataset, which provides essential features required for logistic regression analysis. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including extraction, cleaning, and splitting into training and test data sets.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The data is extracted, cleaned, and prepared for analysis.
2. **Model Training:** Logistic regression is applied to the prepared dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The accuracy parameters of the trained logistic regression model are examined to assess its performance.
4. **Decision Boundary:** Parameters of the linear function derived from logistic regression are extracted to draw the decision boundary between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

**Files Included:**

- `DA623_200122011.ipynb`: Python notebook containing the assignment code.

**Instructions:**

1. Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed before executing the code.
2. Run each cell sequentially to observe the step-by-step process of logistic regression analysis.
3. Analyze the accuracy parameters to evaluate the performance of the model.
4. Review the decision boundary plotted to visualize the classification results.
